			<h1>Wait, no oil changes?</h1>
			<p>
				One undervalued trait of electric vehicles is the smaller number of moving parts. There is no engine and
				there is no transmisson. So this means that maintenance on an EV is significantly lower, including no oil changes!
			</p>
			<p>
				Below are two graphics showing the significance in savings of fuel and maintenance cost as compared to a gasoline-powered vehicle,
				as well as the emissions-savings by moving to electric. The cost savings is about 50% better and the emissions savings is over 200% improved!
				The second graphic shows a maintenance schedule for a Chevrolet Bolt EV (top) along with an equivelently sized gas-powered Chevrolet Cruze. 
				There is a big difference in the number of items recommended every 7,500 miles: only 1-2 items for the Bolt EV and as many as 8-10 items for 
				the Chevy Cruze.
