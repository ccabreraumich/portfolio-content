			<h1>What if I want to take a trip?</h1>
			<p>
				The amount of charging stations has increased enormously over the past 10 years. Below is a map from the Department of Energy showing
				how prevalant charging stations have become throught the United States. You are sure to find a charging station within reach on your
				next road trip!
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, there will be charging stations at every location where we traditionally have gasoline-based fuel. While we are not there yet,
				we are moving in that directly very quickly. There are smartphone apps available to help you plan yoru next trip and locate charging stations
				along your route.
