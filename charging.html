			<h1>How do I charge it?</h1>
			<p>
				Can you imagine being able to fuel your vehicle inside your garage? You can do exactly that with an electric vehicle!
				You can provide up to two levels (or speeds) for charging your vehicle in your house. The next level up, level 3 or DC Fast Charging,
				is currently only available in public facilities. Those are better for road trips when you want to fill up quickly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is not an extensive amount of equipement to buy either! All electric vehicles can plug into a normal 110V plug that you have
				in your house right now! However, this is the most inefficient as it could take as much as 2-3 days to charge a vehicle fully from 0-100% because
				it only adds 2-5 miles of range per hour of charge. However, if your daily commute to work or various errands is 2-5 miles then this option would
				perfectly suit you if you charge every day. Another option is to install a 220V plug into your garage, which would charge your vehicle 5-6x faster
				making this a great choice for most homeowners. This gives you 10-30 miles of range per hour of charging and can charge an empty vehicle in about 7-9 hours
				(overnight)!
