				<h1>How do I charge it?</h1>
				<h2>Can you imagine being able to fuel your vehicle inside your garage?</h2> 
				<p>You can do exactly that with an electric vehicle!
					You can provide up to two levels (or speeds) for charging your vehicle in your house. The next level up, level 3 or DC Fast Charging,
					is currently only available in public facilities. Those are better for road trips when you want to fill up quickly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is not an extensive amount of equipment to buy either! All electric vehicles can plug into a normal 110V plug that you have
					in your house right now! However, this is the most inefficient as it could take as much as 2-3 days to charge a vehicle fully from 0-100% because
					it only adds 2-5 miles of range per hour of charge. However, if your daily commute to work or various errands is 2-5 miles then this option would
					perfectly suit you if you charge every day. Another option is to install a 220V plug into your garage, which would charge your vehicle 5-6x faster
					making this a great choice for most homeowners. This gives you 10-30 miles of range per hour of charging and can charge an empty vehicle in about 7-9 hours
					(overnight)!
